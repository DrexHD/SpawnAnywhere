# SpawnAnywhere
Change your world spawn/respawn location to anywhere.

## Commands
- `/spawnanywhere setspawn` - Sets the initial (first join) spawn location
- `/spawnanywhere setrespawn` - Sets the respawn location if the player doesn't have any other (e.g. bed)

To execute these commands you need be an operator or have `spawnanywhere.root`, `spawnanywhere.setspawn` and 
`spawnanywhere.setrespawn` permission.
